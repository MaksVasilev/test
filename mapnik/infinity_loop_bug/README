If style in XML file have rule to linear object:

    <MarkersSymbolizer file="water-stream-arrow.svg" spacing="0" allow-overlap="false" placement="line"/>
 
then mapnik can't generate output image, this have a infinity loop in progress. Only a kill of process can stop it.

Change spacing to value > 0 and rewrite rule to:

    <MarkersSymbolizer file="water-stream-arrow.svg" spacing="100" allow-overlap="false" placement="line"/>

and mapnik can run as normal (~0.2 sec).

Files:

.xml - mapnik style
.shp - source data to render (linear object)
render.py - python script to render
water-stream-arrow.svg - pattern image
spacing-100-out.pdf - reference output with spacing="100" in style
